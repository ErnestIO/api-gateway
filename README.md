## Build status

* master:  [![CircleCI Master](https://circleci.com/gh/ernestio/api-gateway/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ernestio/api-gateway/tree/master)
* develop: [![CircleCI Develop](https://circleci.com/gh/ernestio/api-gateway/tree/develop.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ernestio/api-gateway/tree/develop)

## Installation

```
make deps
make install
```

## Running Tests

```
make deps
go test
```

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by JWT. You must first authenticate via `/auth/` and use the returned web token as a header in all subsequent requests.

```
curl -i -X POST -d "username=something" -d "password=something" localhost:8080/auth/
```

This will return the following json payload:

```json
{"token":"VALID-AUTH-TOKEN"}
```

This then can be used in subsequent requests, like so:

```
curl -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer VALID-AUTH-TOKEN' localhost:8080/api/users/
```

## Endpoints

Supported endpoints are Users, Groups, Datacenters and Services.
